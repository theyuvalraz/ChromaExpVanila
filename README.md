Razer Blackwidow Chroma V2 - Language indicator (eng/ heb)

it was created for the Blackwidow chroma razer keyboard, was tested only on one computer other than the development one so I hope this will work,


when the capslock is locked, the button(CapsLock) will be illuminated in red, otherwise the base color.
when the Numlock is locked the Numlock buttons will be illuminated in green.
when the Numlock is not locked the Numlock buttons that represent the arrows will be illuminated in pink, and the pageUp/Pagedown/home/end(on the Numpad) will be illuminated yellow
every round half hour an animation will be triggered and color the keys pink three times.
when the language is changed to English an animation will be triggered which will color the English keys green
when the language is changed to Hebrew an animation will be triggered which will color the Hebrew keys Red/salmon color.



mostly written this for personal use so I will have an indicator of the language I am writing in.
also, I have always expected that razer keyboards will come with capslock and numlock indicator out of the box.
as they do not I have remedied this problem.
